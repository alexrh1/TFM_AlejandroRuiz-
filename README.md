This repository contains the code (R and SAS) used for modeling and predicting the duration of a tennis match and a classification model based on Rafael Nadal's statistics over the past few year. These belong to the thesis for the Master in Data Mining and Business Intelligence of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. 

Please considerate that most of the code contains comments in Spanish, as it's the language in which the thesis was done. For further information, don't hesitate to contact the author directly.
