This repository contains the code used for modeling and predicting the duration of a tennis match and also for obtaining a classification model based on Rafael Nadal's statistics over the past few year. These belong to the thesis for the Master in Data Mining and Business Intelligence (UCM)

Please considerate that most of the code contains comments in Spanish, as it's the language in which the thesis was done. For further information, please contact the author directly.
